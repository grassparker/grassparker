## The road to becoming a developer
I never thought I would become a developer one-day, interested in full-stack development, development using XCode and developing games.

# Not a straight line
My journey is never a straight line. I am learning to become a full-stack developer because my back-end has a huge knowledge gap that I am currently working on. Coding sometimes make me feel like quitting, but it is something I cannot truly give up on. Just persevere through. :)

# Current projects:
- [x] StudiLib
- [ ] StudiLib website
- [ ] An IOS app someday...
